  Register a Fact

Facts are resources in Parley used by Condition and Match Nodes for comparisons
within the currently running game. For example, one might want to display
different dialogue depending on whether a condition check is passed or not (e.g.
whether Alice gave a coffee or not).

Facts are stored in a Fact Store which can be configured in the Parley settings.

In this guide, we will create a Fact that can be used to create a Condition Node
in the corresponding
[create a Condition Node guide](./create-condition-node.md).

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have familiarised yourself with the
  [Condition Node](../nodes/condition-node.md) docs.
- Parley is [installed](./installation.md) and running in your Godot Editor.
- You have created a basic Dialogue Sequence before. Consult the
  [Getting Started guide](./create-dialogue-sequence.md) for more info.

## Instructions

> **Note:** it is assumed that the default Parley settings are used for the Fact
> Store and it is stored at: `res://facts/fact_store_main.tres`

1. Create a Fact script (ensure that it extends the `ParleyFactInterface` class)
   at: `res://facts/alice_gave_coffee_fact.gd`

```gdscript Evaluate Fact
extends ParleyFactInterface

func evaluate(ctx: ParleyContext, _values: Array) -> bool:
	print('Did Alice give coffee?')
	# Note, you can return any value here, it doesn't
	# necessarily have to be a bool
	return true
```

2. [OPTIONAL] If the return type of your Fact, is **not** of type `bool`, it is
   recommended to return well-known values of the Fact (for example, when using
   a [Match Node](../nodes/match-node.md)). For example:

```gdscript Example Fact with well-known values
extends ParleyFactInterface

enum DifficultyLevel {
	EASY,
	NORMAL,
	HARD,
}

func evaluate(ctx: ParleyContext, _values: Array) -> int:
	return ctx.get('difficulty_level', DifficultyLevel.NORMAL)

func available_values() -> Array[DifficultyLevel]:
	return [
		DifficultyLevel.EASY,
		DifficultyLevel.NORMAL,
		DifficultyLevel.HARD,
	]
```

3. Open up the `ParleyStores` dock in the Godot Editor and open the `Fact` tab.
4. Click `Add Fact`.
5. Give your new Fact an ID. In our example, we use: `main:alice_gave_coffee`.
6. Give your new Fact a name. In our example, we use: `Alice gave coffee`.
7. Link your created Fact script with the Fact using the resource inspector
   (labelled `Ref`).

> [tip]: You can use the resource Editors in `ParleyStores` to quickly navigate
> to the relevant resource for editing. You can also add resources using the
> resource Editor dropdown field instead of dragging.

8. You should now see that the Fact is available in the Fact dropdown options in
   the Condition Node Editor. Select `Alice gave coffee` in the options to
   associate it with the selected Condition Node.
9. Test out your new Fact within the Dialogue Sequence by clicking the Test
   Dialogue Sequence From Start Button.
