  Create a Dialogue Node
---

A Dialogue Node defines a passage of dialogue for a character within the
Dialogue Sequence. It is associated with a character which can be used to
enhance the displayed dialogue. You can find all sorts of Dialogue Sequence
examples in the Parley
[`examples`](https://github.com/bisterix-studio/parley/tree/main/examples)
folder.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarise yourself with the [Dialogue Node](../nodes/dialogue-node.md) docs.
- Parley is [installed](./installation.md) and running in your Godot Editor.
- You have followed the [instructions](./register-character.md) to add the
  relevant characters to the system.
- You have created a basic Dialogue Sequence before. Consult the
  [Getting Started guide](./create-dialogue-sequence.md) for more info.
