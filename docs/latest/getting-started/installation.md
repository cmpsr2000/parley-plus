> [warn]: When you install Parley for the first time, the following Stores will
> need to be set up, otherwise you will receive some warnings in the Editor:
>
> - Action Store
> - Fact Store
> - Character Store
>
> You don't need to add items to them at this point, just the presence of the
> stores is sufficient.

2. Navigate to the `ParleyStores` dock and select the `Character` tab.
3. Click the `Create and register new Store` button to open the Character Store
   registration modal.
4. Give the Character Store an ID. In our example, we call this: `main`

   example, we set this to: `res://characters/character_store.tres`
6. Click: `Register` to save and register the Character Store. You should see
   the warning button disappear in the `ParleyStores` dock.
7. The Character Store is now set up and ready to be used. You can find out more
